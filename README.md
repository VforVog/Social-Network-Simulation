# Social Network Simulation â€“ Java Project

## Overview
This Java application simulates a basic social networking system.  
It allows user creation, managing friendships, suggesting friends, handling posts, creating groups, identifying potentially infected users based on social interactions, and interacting through a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

### User Management
- Create users with name and university email.
- Validates emails that start with `dai`, `iis`, or `ics` and end with `@uom.edu.gr`.

### Friendship System
- Add and manage friendships between users.
- Check if friendships are mutual.
- Find common friends between two users.

### Friend Suggestions
- Suggest friends based on mutual connections (friends of friends).

### Groups
- Create and manage two types of groups:
  - Public Group
  - Closed Group (restricted access)

### Posts
- Users can create and view textual posts.
- Posts include a timestamp for tracking.

### Infection Simulation
- A user can be marked as "infected" (e.g., due to a virus or rumor).
- The system identifies:
  - Direct contacts (friends)
  - Indirect contacts (friends of infected users)
- All potentially infected users are flagged.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Search for users by name.
- View friends, emails, and suggested connections.
- Create and browse user posts.
- Navigate easily with a Swing-based interface.

## Class Descriptions

- **User**: Represents a user with name, email, friend list, posts, and infection status.
- **Post**: Represents a user's post with content and timestamp.
- **Group**: Represents a general group with a member list.
- **Closed_Group**: Subclass of `Group` that restricts member access.
- **Main**: Contains application logic including user creation, friendships, infection spread, and GUI initialization.
- **GUI**: Implements a Swing-based user interface for searching users, displaying friends, and interacting with posts.

## Infection Logic
- A user is marked as "infected".
- The program identifies all direct friends.
- It then traces all users indirectly connected (friends of infected users).
- All affected users are listed as potentially infected.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK installed (version 8 or later)

### Compile

## Usage
When the application starts, a window will open allowing:
- User search
- Viewing and managing friends
- Creating and reading posts
- Navigating between screens

## Email Validation
Only university emails are accepted. Valid emails must:
- Begin with `dai`, `iis`, or `ics`
- End with `@uom.edu.gr`

**Examples:**
-  Valid: `dai2023@uom.edu.gr`
-  Invalid: `john@gmail.com`

## Example Scenario
- The application initializes with 8 predefined users and their friendships.
- An infection is simulated starting from a specific user (e.g., Gianna).
- The program then identifies and prints all users who are directly or indirectly connected to the infected user and might also be infected.
